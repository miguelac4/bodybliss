##  Development Structure

The development was structured into three distinct phases, allowing a progressive and systematic approach to building the solution:

###  Problem Analysis
In this initial phase, the main system modules, the functionalities to be implemented, and the data structures to be used were identified, ensuring a solid foundation for the following phases.

### Web Application Development
Based on the analysis carried out, the **implementation of the application** was initiated, using **web programming techniques** that ensure a **fluid, secure, and personalized user experience**.

### Testing and Validation
Finally, **validation tests** were carried out with the aim of **verifying the correct functioning of the application**, ensuring that **all functional requirements were met** and that the **system responds reliably to different user interactions**.
