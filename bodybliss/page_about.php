        <strong>BODYBLISS</strong> was born from my passion for Therapeutic Massages and the creation of unique handmade pieces, like aromatic candles and Jesmonite décor.
    </p>
    <p>
        The name combines “BODY” (body, self) with “BLISS” (ecstasy, happiness), reflecting the purpose of offering well-being, relaxation, and harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each candle is crafted with care and tailored to the preferences of the person receiving it — more than just decoration, they are gifts with soul.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether through a massage with natural oils or by lighting a custom-made BODYBLISS candle, the goal is always the same: to help you slow down and reconnect with your inner self.
